### Features :sparkles:

:heart_eyes: **URL shortning made simple**: kotinga uses [jsonstore.io](https://www.jsonstore.io) to  store data on an endpoint JSON file using HTTPS requests. It works on any url.

:heart: **No server side logging**: Your privacy is important for us. We never log, collect or prompt to sell your data to anyone.

:fire: **Custom and random alias support**: Add your own custom alias or generate a random one.

:1234: **Generate QR code**: Create and download shortened URL's QR code.

:alembic: **Manage URLs**: Delete already created alias to update/create new URLs.

:zap: **Performance**: kotinga is a thin web app on top of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Being a Progressive web app, kotinga offers lightning fast loading and offline support via workbox and service worker.

:information_desk_person: **Browser extension**:  Get mnmlurl [Chrome browser extension](https://github.com/liyasthomas/mnmlurl-extension)

<span style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT: Kotinga is an experimental project. Don't shorten sensitive contents/URLs with it. jsonstore.io endpoints are always public making shortened URLs visible for everyone.**</span>
