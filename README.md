# kotinga

## :link: Kotinga was a fork of the modern URL shortener with support for custom alias by [Liyas Thomas](https://github.com/liyasthomas)

<div align="center">

  <img src="images/screen.png" alt="kotinga" width="100%">
  <img src="images/screen2.png" alt="kotinga" width="100%">
  <br>
</div>

## Features :sparkles:

:heart_eyes: **URL shortning made simple**: kotinga used [jsonstore.io](https://www.jsonstore.io) to store data on an endpoint JSON file using HTTPS requests. It worked on any url.

:heart: **No server side logging**: Your privacy is important for us. We never log, collect or prompt to sell your data to anyone.

:fire: **Custom and random alias support**: You could add your own custom alias or generate a random one.

:1234: **Generate QR code**: Create and download shortened URL's QR code.

:alembic: **Manage URLs**: You could delete already created alias to update/create new URLs.

:zap: **Performance**: kotinga was a thin web app on top of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
